abstract: Spatial frequency shift (SFS) microscopy with evanescent wave
  illumination shows intriguing advantages, including large field of view (FOV),
  high speed, and good modularity. However, a missing band in the spatial
  frequency domain hampers the SFS superresolution microscopy from achieving
  resolution better than 3 folds of the Abbe diffraction limit. Here, we propose
  a novel tunable large-SFS microscopy, making the resolution improvement of a
  linear system no longer restricted by the detection numerical aperture (NA).
  The complete wide-range detection in the spatial frequency domain is realized
  by tuning the illumination spatial frequency actively and broadly through an
  angle modulation between the azimuthal propagating directions of two
  evanescent waves. The vertical spatial frequency is tuned via a sectional
  saturation effect, and the reconstructed depth information can be added to the
  lateral superresolution mask for 3D imaging. A lateral resolution of λ/9, and
  a vertical localization precision of ∼λ/200 (detection objective NA = 0.9) are
  realized with a gallium phosphide (GaP) waveguide. Its unlimited resolution
  enhancing capability is demonstrated by introducing a designed metamaterial
  chip with an unusual large refractive index. Besides the great resolution
  enhancement, this method shows better anti-noise capability than classical
  structured illumination microscopy without SFS tunability. This method is
  chip-compatible and can potentially provide a mass-producible illumination
  chip module achieving the fast, large-FOV, and deep-subwavelength 3D
  nanoscopy.
